# Approach:

In this assignment, I took the Flask application that I made in Module 1 and pushed it to DockerHub as a DockerImage. 

I first linted all of my Python code using Pylint. I then created a Dockerfile that constructs a Docker Image. Lastly, I pushed my DockerImage to my public Dockerhub repo.

# Known Bugs:
None
